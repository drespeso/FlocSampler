DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------

This package contains two independent MATLAB written scripts (in two separated folders) to process Flow Cytometry and CSLM data and compute described metrics in the
manuscript "Quantitative assesment of morphological traits of planktonic bacterial aggregates".

Within each folder, you may find the *.m scripts together with one or more files / folders containing example preprocessed FC / CSLM data to run the scripts.

In order to execute the scripts, it is necessary to keep the given order to the folders / files. Otherwise adjustements at code level shall be required

Some implemented algorithms are based on previously published work. They are properly referenced at the header of these scripts.


WARNING !

This is NOT an end user program to work. It is a calculation tool to obtain data as described in the manuscript. Although the code has been ordered and 
commented to orientate the reader what the script is doing, there is no exhaustive description of the variables. Thus structure and accessibility have not
been designed to be beauty nor robust, but practical.


SHARING AND MODIFICATIONS

Scripts are shared under MIT license, thus feel free to use or modify this files at will. We hope they can be useful for your purposes XD!
